This is a version of [Cheap Bots, Done Quick!](http://cheapbotsdonequick.com/) that runs as twitter.com/OnceInALifeBot. 

It tweets a variation on David Byrne's lyrics from Once In A Lifetime starting with "And you may find yourself..." and ending with "...And you may ask yourself how did I get here?"
